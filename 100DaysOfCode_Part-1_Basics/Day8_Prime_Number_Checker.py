# def prime_checker(number):

#   for i in range(2, number): ---> here our range is from 2 to number meaning range starts from 2 and ends number-1 (does not include number). So since we dont have 1 and number itself which are the only numbers prime numbers can be divisible by, if number divisible by any number(i) cleanly, its not a prime number anymore.
